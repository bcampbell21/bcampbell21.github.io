<u><h1>About Me</h1></u>
</div>
	<u><p> I am 14 years old and live on Long Island. I go to <a href="https://www.ross.org/">The Ross School</a> in East Hampton. My main interest is dirtbiking and working on them. I made this website for a project in innovation lab. Innovation Lab is a course in the Ross School. For three weeks I will be taking part in an Ilab couse in which I and many other students will learn skills in technology and engineering.  </p> </u>

<u><p> One of the projects I have done was restoring an old dirtbike. It was a 1984 yz80. I took it down to the frame and restored all of it including the motor. I ended up selling the bike for more than double the cost i bough it for. Below are the before and after pictures. </p></u>
